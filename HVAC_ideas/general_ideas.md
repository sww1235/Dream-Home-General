-hvac system uses central ventilation supplied from roof and exausted out through sides of house
-use large heat recovery unit between external and incoming air. May integrate with waste heat
coils to both provide preheating of incomng air for dehumidification and elimination of excess
waste heat
-Central Ventilation system provides exaust and makeup air for process, cooking and bathroom 
applications as well as general outside air requirements so exaust has grease filters
-Energy/Enthalpy Recovery Ventilators in between exaust and fresh air
-fireplace chimneys are seperately exausted, but flow monitored so makeup air can be introduced
They also have heat recovery coils to extract extra waste heat and combustion product filtering
Fireplaces also have heat distribution fans to help move extra heat into the room

-room units do bulk of heating/conditionign new ventilation air that they introduce into rooms.

-4 pipe system, with possiblity of seperate process water loops as well

-heated water from the chilled water return is used to preheat the outgoing heated water supply


-sources of heat
    -chilled water return
    -solar hot water
    -ground source heat pump
    -makeup electric boiler
    -water source heat pump (depending on water availability)
-sources of cold
    -hot water return?
    -ground source heat pump
    -chillers + cooling towers
    -water source heat pump (depending on water availability)


Implement thermal storage for both hot and cold
