listed in approximate order of requirement

-   Water connection-preferably on a river with a connection to the ocean. Also
near a water based community that allows for the use of boats instead of cars

-   Large quantity of land (greater than 4 acres, 40+ prefered)

-   Connected Garage and boathouse

-   boathouse has drive in access with potential to become a drydock

-   small lake as roundabout for boats

-   long driveway with potential to restrict access

-   long waterway with potential to restrict access

-   at least 2 redundant connections to all Utilties(if within range),
along with private replacements with duplicates as well

-   idea is for house to be powered primarily off solar power and sell
excess back to the utility company. Also allow for buying more
electricity from the utiltiy company when needed. also allows for
complete self sufficiency so be able to disconnect solar from utility
and run with batteries/other forms of generation. Finally be able to
provice power back to the grid in emergincies if requested.
